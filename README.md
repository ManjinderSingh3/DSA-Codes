# DSA Patterns Practice
This repository is a collection of coding problems solved pattern-wise to help build strong problem-solving skills and recognize common algorithmic techniques. The goal is to master the art of identifying patterns, not just solving problems randomly.

## Why pattern-based practice
Solving problems based on patterns allows for:
- Faster recognition of solutions during interviews

- Better understanding of underlying concepts

- Reusability of techniques across multiple problem types

## Patterns Covered
1. Two Pointers
2. Fast and Slow Pointer
3. Sliding Window
4. Subset Problems
